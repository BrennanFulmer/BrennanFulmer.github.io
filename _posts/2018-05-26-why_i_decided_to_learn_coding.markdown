<p> At my last job I was asked to come up with the role I would like to be doing and to pick a certification to work towards that path. I ended up writing a pros and cons list to help me figure it out. This lead me to realize that what I enjoyed most about working in technical support for bussinesses was primarily writing code (at the time this mostly Batch scripts) and working in a team.
</p>
<p> I ended up trying out a number of different free bootcamp prep courses. This led me to discover that I really enjoyed creating things. I ended up liking it so much that I decided to pursue the career change full time. 
</p>
 <p> This whole experience made me think back to when I was originally deciding what major to pursue in college. At that time I passed over computer science because I thought I didn't have the math skills needed or that there weren't many jobs available. Strangely enough some of my favorite projects have been about coming up with algorithms to find things like the highest prime factor. In retrospect its kind of funny that I was concerned about being able to get a job in programming even five years ago. </p>
